              <b>Full Abstract</b></br>
              We propose Leapfrog Flow Maps (LFM) to simulate incompressible fluids with rich vortical flows in real time. Our key idea is to use a hybrid velocityimpulse scheme enhanced with leapfrog method to reduce the computational workload of impulse-based flow map methods, while possessing strong ability to preserve vortical structures and fluid details. In order to accelerate the impulse-to-velocity projection, we develop a fast matrix-free Algebraic Multigrid Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (AMGPCG) solver with customized GPU optimization, which makes projection comparable with impulse evolution in terms of time cost. We demonstrate the performance of our method and its efficacy in a wide range of examples and experiments, such as real-time simulated burning fire ball and delta wingtip vortices.

                In this work, we bring existing flow-map techniques under one roof, handling phenomena from tiny water-striders skimming pond surfaces to ships on vast oceans and even a Dragon capsule’s descent onto Mars. We’ve validated our solver against standard JCP benchmarks, demonstrating accuracy on par with high-order WENO methods for supersonic compressible flows, while simultaneously improving vorticity preservation in shallow-water and weakly compressible scenarios.

              <b>Full Abstract</b></br>
              This paper presents a unified compressible flow map framework designed to accommodate diverse compressible flow systems, including high-Mach-number flows (e.g., shock waves and supersonic aircraft), weakly compressible systems (e.g., smoke plumes and ink diffusion), and incompressible systems evolving through compressible acoustic quantities (e.g., free-surface shallow water). At the core of our approach is a theoretical foundation for compressible flow maps based on Lagrangian path integrals, a novel advection scheme for the conservative transport of density and energy, and a unified numerical framework for solving compressible flows with varying pressure treatments. We validate our method across three representative compressible flow systems, characterized by varying fluid morphologies, governing equations, and compressibility levels, demonstrating its ability to preserve and evolve spatiotemporal features such as vortical structures and wave interactions governed by different flow physics. Our results highlight a wide range of novel phenomena, from ink torus breakup to delta wing tail vortices and vortex shedding on free surfaces, significantly expanding the range of fluid systems that flow-map methods can handle.</br>

              It’s a pleasure to report that our work, “EDGE: Epsilon-Difference Gradient Evolution for Buffer-Free Flow Maps”, has just been accepted to SIGGRAPH 2025! 🎉🎉🎉</br> 
              Our Epsilon Difference Gradient Evolution (EDGE) solver marries a Hermite-based flow-map approach with a tetrahedral epsilon-difference scheme to eliminate velocity buffers entirely.
              By combining first-order Gradient Evolution with this epsilon-difference trick, we collapse spatial complexity from O(n) to O(1), so you can trace flows over long paths without ever losing a hint of vorticity.</br>
              <b>Here are the standout points from our work:</b></br>
              🌟 A buffer-free flow-map method with O(1) memory usage, independent of flow-map length, while preserving vorticity accuracy comparable to buffer-based approaches</br>
              🌟 A novel high-order advection scheme that evolves first-order derivatives and computes high-order mixed derivatives via the epsilon difference method, overcoming limitations of prior methods</br>
              🌟 A tetrahedron-based epsilon element scheme that further reduces computational cost, enabling efficient flow-map simulations</br>

              We propose the Epsilon Difference Gradient Evolution (EDGE) method for accurate flow-map calculation on grids via Hermite interpolation without using velocity buffers. Our key idea is to integrate Gradient Evolution for accurate first-order derivatives and a tetrahedron-based Epsilon Difference scheme to compute higher-order derivatives with reduced memory consumption. EDGE achieves O(1) memory usage, independent of flow map length, while maintaining vorticity preservation comparable to buffer-based methods. We validate our methods across diverse vortical flow scenarios, demonstrating up to 90% backward map memory reduction and significant computational efficiency, broadening the applicability of flow-map methods to large-scale and complex fluid simulations.

              <b>Full Abstract</b></br>
              We propose the adaptive hybrid particle-grid flow map method, a novel flow-map approach that leverages Lagrangian particles to simultaneously transport impulse and guide grid adaptation, introducing a fully adaptive flow map-based fluid simulation framework. The core idea of our method is to maintain flow-map trajectories separately on grid nodes and particles: the grid-based representation tracks long-range flow maps at a coarse spatial resolution, while the particle-based representation tracks both long and short-range flow maps, enhanced by their gradients, at a fine resolution. This hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian flow-map representation naturally enables adaptivity for both advection and projection steps. We implement this method in Cirrus, a GPU-based fluid simulation framework designed for octree-like adaptive grids enhanced with particle trackers. The efficacy of our system is demonstrated through numerical tests and various simulation examples, achieving up to 512×512×2048 effective resolution on an RTX 4090 GPU. We achieve a 1.5 to 2× speedup with our GPU optimization over the Particle Flow Map method on the same hardware, while the adaptive grid implementation offers efficiency gains of one to two orders of magnitude by reducing computational resource requirements.

              <b>Full Abstract</b></br>
              We propose the Vortex Particle Flow Map (VPFM) method to simulate incompressible flow with complex vortical evolution in the presence of dynamic solid boundaries. The core insight of our approach is that vorticity is an ideal quantity for evolution on particle flow maps, enabling significantly longer flow map distances compared to other fluid quantities like velocity or impulse. To achieve this goal, we developed a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian representation that evolves vorticity and flow map quantities on vortex particles, while reconstructing velocity on a background grid. The method integrates three key components: (1) a vorticity-based particle flow map framework, (2) an accurate Hessian evolution scheme on particles, and (3) a solid boundary treatment for no-through and no-slip conditions in VPFM. These components collectively allow a substantially longer flow map length (3-12 times longer) than the state-of-the-art, enhancing vorticity preservation over extended spatiotemporal domains. We validated the performance of VPFM through diverse simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex vortex dynamics and turbulence phenomena.

              <p class="post-excerpt">
              <b>Next Steps</b></br>
              After this preliminary investigation, we will continue to explore the efficacy of the VPFM method in simulating multi-scale and multi-physics problems. One the one hand, we will explore the potential of the significantly extended flow map lengths of vortex particles compared to other flow map techniques to facilitate multi-scale vortex structure evolution. On the other hand, we will focus on developing multi-physics coupling frameworks and investigating a variety of vortex–solid interaction phenomena. One of the primary objectives of our ongoing research is to extend the VPFM method from the computer graphics community to the broader computational physics community.

              <b>Full Abstract</b></br>
              This paper introduces a two-phase interfacial fluid model based on the impulse variable to capture complex vorticity-interface interactions. Our key idea is to leverage bidirectional flow map theory to enhance the transport accuracy of both vorticity and interfaces simultaneously and address their coupling within a unified Eulerian framework. At the heart of our framework is an impulse ghost fluid method to solve the two-phase incompressible fluid characterized by its interfacial dynamics. To deal with the history-dependent jump of gauge variables across a dynamic interface, we develop a novel path integral formula empowered by spatiotemporal buffers to convert the history-dependent jump condition into a geometry-dependent jump condition when projecting impulse to velocity. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in simulating and visualizing several interface-vorticity interaction problems with cross-phase vortical evolution, including interfacial whirlpool, vortex ring reflection, and leapfrogging bubble rings.

              <b>Full Abstract</b></br>
              We present an Eulerian vortex method based on the theory of flow maps to simulate the complex vortical motions of incompressible fluids. Central to our method is the novel incorporation of the flow-map transport equations for line elements, which, in combination with a bi-directional marching scheme for flow maps, enables the high-fidelity Eulerian advection of vorticity variables. The fundamental motivation is that, compared to impulse 𝒎, which has been recently bridged with flow maps to encouraging results, vorticity 𝝎 promises to be preferable for its numerically stability and physical interpretability. To realize the full potential of this novel formulation, we develop a new Poisson solving scheme for vorticity-to-velocity reconstruction that is both efficient and able to accurately handle the coupling near solid boundaries. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with a range of vortex simulation examples, including leapfrog vortices, vortex collisions, cavity flow, and the formation of complex vortical structures due to solid-fluid interactions.

                We introduce a path integral technique that solves the problem of perform two-way coupling between fluid and solid under flow map methods. At its heart are two clever tricks: an impulse-to-velocity transfer step that makes exchanging forces seamless, and a path-integral accumulation that carries coupling forces along each particle's trajectory.
                By converting impulse variable mapped through flow map to a divergent velocity field, we can easily couple with existing solid-fluid interaction methods such as MPM and IBM with only trivial modifications.

              We propose a novel solid-fluid interaction method for coupling elastic solids with impulse flow maps. Our key idea is to unify the representation of fluid and solid components as particle flow maps with different lengths and dynamics. The solid-fluid coupling is enabled by implementing two novel mechanisms: first, we developed an impulse-to-velocity transfer mechanism to unify the exchanged physical quantities; second, we devised a particle path integral mechanism to accumulate coupling forces along each flow-map trajectory. Our framework integrates these two mechanisms into an Eulerian-Lagrangian impulse fluid simulator to accommodate traditional coupling models, exemplified by the Material Point Method (MPM) and Immersed Boundary Method (IBM), within a particle flow map framework. We demonstrate our method's efficacy by simulating solid-fluid interactions exhibiting strong vortical dynamics, including various vortex shedding and interaction examples across swimming, falling, breezing, and combustion.

              <b>Full Abstract</b></br>
              We propose a novel Particle Flow Map (PFM) method to enable accurate long-range advection for incompressible fluid simulation. The foundation of our method is the observation that a particle trajectory generated in a forward simulation naturally embodies a perfect flow map. Centered on this concept, we have developed an Eulerian-Lagrangian framework comprising four essential components: Lagrangian particles for a natural and precise representation of bidirectional flow maps; a dual-scale map representation to accommodate the mapping of various flow quantities; a particle-to-grid interpolation scheme for accurate quantity transfer from particles to grid nodes; and a hybrid impulse-based solver to enforce incompressibility on the grid. The efficacy of PFM has been demonstrated through various simulation scenarios, highlighting the evolution of complex vortical structures and the details of turbulent flows. Notably, compared to NFM, PFM reduces computing time by up to 49 times and memory consumption by up to 41%, while enhancing vorticity preservation as evidenced in various tests like leapfrog, vortex tube, and turbulent flow.
